Tee dum, tee dee, the words are easy to say
Just a teedle ee dum a teedle ee do tee day
Tee dum, tee dee, a teedle ee do tee dum
We're one for all, and all of us out for fun
We march in line and follow the other one
With a teedle ee do a teedle ee do tee dum
Following the leader, the leader, the leader
We're following the leader
Wherever he may go
We're out to fight the Injuns, the Injuns, the Injuns
We're out to fight the Injuns
Because he told us so
Tee dum, tee dee a teedle ee do tee day
We march along and these are the words we say

Oh, a teedle ee dum a teedle ee do tee day
Oh, a teedle ee dum a teedle ee-do-tee-day
