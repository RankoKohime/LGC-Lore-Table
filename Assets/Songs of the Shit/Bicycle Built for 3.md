Bicycle Built for 3
===================

## Venn
Pedro, Pedro, give me your answer true (must I?)
I’m half crazy over the hate of you (oh well that's okay then)
It won’t be a stylish marriage
I can’t afford a carriage
But you’ll look sweet
Upon the seat

## All three
Of a bicycle built for three

## Jordan
Venn, Venn, give me your answer true (hmm?)
Will you let me peddle along with you (nah)
When you and I go cruisin’ (we won't)
You’ll thank me for choosin’ (not a chance)
You to come and have some fun

## All three
On a bicycle built for three

## Pedro
Jordan, Jordan, give me your answer true (no)
I love riding, do you love it too (No!)
Slow or fast or faster
You lead, I’ll follow after (off a cliff maybe?)
The path flies by as you and I

## All three
Ride a bicycle built for three

A bicycle built for three


There is a flower within my heart, Daisy, Daisy!
Planted one day by a glancing dart,
Planted by Daisy Bell!
Whether she loves me or loves me not,
Sometimes it's hard to tell;
Yet I am longing to share the lot
Of beautiful Daisy Bell!

CHORUS. (a little faster.)
Daisy, Daisy,
Give me your answer, do!
I'm half crazy,
All for the love of you!
It won't be a stylish marriage,
I can't afford a carriage,
But you'll look sweet on the seat
Of a bicycle built for two!

We will go "tandem" as man and wife, Daisy, Daisy!
"Ped'ling" away down the road of life, I and my Daisy Bell!
When the road's dark we can both despise P'liceman and "lamps" as well;
There are "bright lights" in the dazzling eyes Of beautiful Daisy Bell!
(Chorus)

I will stand by you in "wheel" or woe, Daisy, Daisy!
You'll be the bell(e) which I'll ring you know! Sweet little Daisy Bell!
You'll take the "lead" in each "trip" we take, Then if I don't do well;
I will permit you to use the brake, My beautiful Daisy Bell!
(Chorus)
