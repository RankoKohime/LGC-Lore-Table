Bicycle Built for 3
===================

Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true
I’m half crazy over the love of you
It won’t be a stylish marriage
I can’t afford a carriage
But you’ll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

Ruby, Ruby, give me your answer true
Will you let me peddle along with you
When you and I go cruisin’
You’ll thank me for choosin’
You to come and have some fun
On a bicycle built for two

Billy, Billy, give me your answer true
I love riding, do you love it too
Slow or fast or faster
You lead, I’ll follow after
The path flies by as you and I
Ride a bicycle built for two

A bicycle built for two
