Pickletickler McAssclown
========================

According to Frojoe:

"So according to RNJesus, Pickletickler McAssclown is a priest.   Not a particularly charismatic or persuasive one, but his devotion to the gods of booga booga afford him great power.   I think maybe he's a monastery orphan who never had a name growing up.   Pickletickler McAssclown is an epithet that was applied to him, that he started to identify with and wear as armor"

"He's neutral, so he's pretty self interested.   I'm not sure if he's particularly vindictive about the name he was given, but he definitely introduces himself as "Pickles" and not his full name"
